For the past 50 years, Portland, Oregon has warmed at an average rate of 0.016 °C per year (about 0.16 °C per decade), based on NOAA’s Global Historical Climatology Network Daily (GHCND) dataset (NOAA NCEI, 2024a). This rate is slightly lower than the global average warming calculated by NOAA for 1982–2023 (0.20 °C per decade) (NOAA NCEI, 2024b), but it still represents a clear long-term warming signal. The R² value of 0.088 shows that much of the year-to-year variation comes from natural climate variability, yet the overall slope remains positive.

Portland’s proximity to the Pacific Ocean means its climate is strongly influenced by large-scale patterns such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) (NOAA PSL, 2024) and the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) (NOAA Climate.gov, 2024). These oscillations can mask or amplify the underlying warming trend. For example, the late 1970s and early 1980s show a stretch of cooler years that align with a cool phase of the PDO, while the 1990s and especially the 2010s contain clusters of notably warm years, some coinciding with strong El Niño events. These alternating cool and warm stretches illustrate the “noise” of natural variability on top of the long-term trend.

Background research on regional climate (ClimateStations, 2024) describes Portland’s climate as mild, with wet winters and dry summers, moderated by maritime influences. That Portland shows a persistent warming trend despite this moderation underscores the broader signal of climate change in the Pacific Northwest.
